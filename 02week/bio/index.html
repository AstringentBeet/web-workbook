              <span class="emphasis">Ezra Effanga</span> is an oddly flamboyant, native-born Austinite, who hopes of pursuing his dream of becoming
              an application devolper while participating in spoken word as a side project (he won't dig what I just told you). He deeply
              appreciates your visit, and although he realizes that each and every individual has the right to determine
              their own subjective value towards objective reality, he can't help but have a lingering,
              borderline obsessive hope that you enjoy what you come across. Cheers!

          <p>I was born and raised in the great city of Austin, Texas, where weirdness prevails over conventional standards
            (for the most part, at least), which is one of many things I will be forever thankful for. Coupled with an overactive
            imagination and interest for the unknown, my interest in coding began in search for a creative outlet where I could sustain
            myself in the rapidly-evolving, technology driven era. As I pursueI'm completely foriegn to, but the fact that
            it not only provides an oppurtunity to unmask a creative outlet for myself, it's also a conveninently rising occupation in the job
            market. Conclusions has always been awkward for me, so I guess I'll finish with both a personal and public affirmation:
            Give me a few months to learn, and I will not dissapoint *nervous thumbs up*.</p>
