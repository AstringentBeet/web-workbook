              <span class="emphasis">Ezra Akiloye</span> is an oddly flamboyant, native-born Austinite, who hopes of pursuing his dream of becoming
              an application devolper while participating in spoken word as a side project (he won't dig what I just told you). He deeply
              appreciates your visit and, though he realizes that each and every individual has the right to determine
              their own subjective value towards objective reality, he can't help but have a lingering,
              borderline obsessive hope that you enjoy what you come across; I promise.
