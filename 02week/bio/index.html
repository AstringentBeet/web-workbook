              <span class="emphasis">Ezra Effanga</span> is an oddly flamboyant, native-born Austinite, who hopes of pursuing his dream of becoming
              an application devolper while participating in spoken word as a side project (he won't dig what I just told you). He deeply
              appreciates your visit, and although he realizes that each and every individual has the right to determine
              their own subjective value towards objective reality, he can't help but have a lingering,
              borderline obsessive hope that you enjoy what you come across. Cheers!

          <p>I was born and raised in the great city of Austin, Texas, where weirdness prevails over conventional standards
            (for the most part, at least), which is one of many things I will be forever thankful for. My interest in coding
            began in search for a creative outlet where I could sustain myself in the rapidly-evolving, technology driven era.
            As you can tell from the plastered collage of random images in the background, I'm fairly new to the applicative process
            of coding, but my interest in it fuels me to pursue higher levels of understanding in the field.</p>
