                <p> Welcome to an experimental blog of an aspiring programmer, Alexander Effanga (Ezra, preferably)!
                  Thanks for taking the time to look over my projects completed over the past few months.
                  Feel free to contact me at juxtaposedowl@gmail.com.

        <h3>Stellar Story(Pseudo-bio)</h3>
          <p>There isn't much to say regarding the events of my life, besides the simplistic fact that
            I have a growing  interest in the field of code. My bio is on another page, but for the sake
            of content, why not add a bit of...<em>spice? Dazzle?</em> Anywho, my goal in life is to be a peace-keeping,
            Wing Chun fighting, politically analytical sage. Think I'm joking? Partially...but that's besides the point!
            It's a pretty cool idea the more I feed into it.</p>

                     orders, knowledge of the menu to provide information to both first time and seasoned (ba-dum-tss) customers, and

          <h3>Software Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Haha...as stated in the introductory article, my general knowledge of programming is quite new. With that being said,
              I do have knowledge with a bit of:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>Javascript</li>
              </ul>
            <p>Over the next few months, I hope to expand upon, and hopefully increase my knowledge and abilities of these languages
              at a proficient rate. In the meantime, stay tuned!</p>
