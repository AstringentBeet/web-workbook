          <h1>Education</h1>
            <p>
              I must admit that this will be the least impressive of my background, but it's a truth that I cannot deny.
              Besides the basic public education that one receives from elementary through highschool, I attended Austin community
              College to pursue a degree in computer engineering. Other than that, my "expansive" background is anything but.

                  As a Barista, making drinks isn't my sole duty, believe it or not. It involves flexibility, teamwork,

                  orders, knowledge of the menu to provide information to both first time and seasoned (ba-dum-tss) customers, and
                  daily (minutely) cleaning procedures. Ah, and a smile, fake or not, can go a long way to help a customer through
                  their day.
