                “The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it.
                Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city.
                While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive.
                One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly.

                The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar.
                But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits.
                Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him.
                He can no longer see past his own thoughts
                He’s trapped.

                When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take roots, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city.
                The result?
                Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant.
                Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle.
                Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different, they are one and the same."
